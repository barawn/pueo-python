# Simple Event Display

These guys are designed to run in a Jupyter notebook. You can literally
do it on jupyter.org's Try Jupyter site.

Just upload these files, create a notebook, and do

```
from display import EventDisplay
ed = EventDisplay()
ed.run()
```

You can then upload either ".wf" or ".wfs" files (I think!). You can
concatenate them together as well, it doesn't matter, it'll parse
them all.
