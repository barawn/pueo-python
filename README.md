# PUEO Hardware Python modules

Simple Python code to interact with PUEO hardware configurations.

## Reorganization

This repository was reorganized to separate files easily by
functionality. You will need to add the repository directory to
PYTHONPATH so that scripts will work.

## hexfile

the SPIFlash library requires hexfile, which is here:

https://github.com/ryansturmer/hexfile

Maybe move this here at some point.
